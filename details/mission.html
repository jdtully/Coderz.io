            <div class="col-sm-12">The Mission of Coderz.io...
                ,The mission of Coderz.io is to educate students to become citizens of the coding community, who
                demonstrate strong
                respect, compassion, integrity, self-discipline, curiosty and a willingness to lay down readable,
                efficient code.

                Good members of the coding community think critically, creatively, yet still logically about problems
                any complexity level.
                They create when necessary, adapt when appropriate, and employ a broad range of technological and
                communication skills to seek understanding and find solutions to real problems.

                Our goal is to teach the highest standards and practices which will enable you to more easily fit in
                with any group.

                While you never stop learning Our goal is to have you gain the knowledge, skills, experiences, and
                independence to meet the challenges of coding in the ever evolving coding world.


                Core Values

                Coderz is dedicated to developing habits which will sustain lifelong learning in students.
                Learning how to learn -- whether it be taking notes, studying, or writing -- prepares students for
                success in the coding world and in life. Our teachers nurture confident and critical thinkers who have
                mastered
                learning skills and competencies across a variety of disciplines.
